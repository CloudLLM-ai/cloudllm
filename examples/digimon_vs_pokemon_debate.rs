//! Digimon vs Pokemon Debate Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates the Council API in Moderated mode with a fun debate
//! between two experts arguing about which franchise is better: Digimon or Pokemon.
//!
//! The debate features:
//! - A neutral moderator who guides the discussion
//! - A Digimon enthusiast who champions Digimon
//! - A Pokemon expert who advocates for Pokemon
//!
//! Topics covered:
//! - Story depth and character development
//! - Gameplay mechanics and strategy
//! - Cultural impact and longevity
//! - Animation quality and world-building
//! - Innovation and evolution of the franchises
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```bash
//! export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
//! export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
//! cargo run --example digimon_vs_pokemon_debate
//! ```
//!
//! **Note**: This example takes 1-3 minutes as it makes sequential API calls.
//! The Moderated mode means the moderator selects speakers, creating a more
//! dynamic conversation flow.
